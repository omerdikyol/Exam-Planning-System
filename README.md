2. **Configuration**:
   - Update the `config.php` file with your database credentials (e.g., `servername`, `username`, `password`).

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Place the project files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP or `www` for WAMP).
   - Access the application via a web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/ExamPlanningSystem`).

4. **Login**:
   - Use the `login.php` page to log in with valid credentials.
   - The system will redirect you to the appropriate dashboard based on your role.
